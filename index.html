I have been looking for a sprite editor to create small (as in 8x8 to 16x16)
pixelated sprites and tiles in a spritesheet.  I was not too happy with the
offerings.  On the PC, I've mostly been using Gimp, which is OK but has no
animation and tile facilities. I also tried GraphicsGale and a couple of
others, which I didn't like very much.  Further, I wanted a sprite editor that
also works on Android.  I looked for sprite editors on Android or HTML sprite
editors, but found they mostly suck.

<p>

So, I've made my own.  I wanted it to run in a Web browser and on Android.
The editor assumes equally sized small sprites arranged in a sprite sheet.
Editing is based on a single sprite within the sprite sheet.

</ul>

Features:

<ul>

<li>Works on any modern browser, also works well on mobile (tablet). It stores
your image persistently so that it doesn't get lost when reloading the page.

<li>Sprite sheet based editing

<li>Data transfer via load/save PNG or data URLs

<li>Fixed palette, colour pick, colour hex code entry

<li>Various operations, like flip, rotate, shift, insert/delete row,
add outline, flood fill, merge

<li>Undo/Redo

<li>Tiling preview

<li>Realtime animation preview with pingpong option

<li>Onion skinning

<li>Configurable interface colours, edit zoom, preview zoom, onion skin

</ul>
