I have been looking for a sprite editor for quickly creating small 
(as in 8x8 to 16x16) pixelated sprites and tiles in a spritesheet.  Further, I
wanted one that also works on Android.  There are a number of good PC sprite
editors, but they are not tailored to this specific style of spriting.  I also
looked for Android apps or online sprite editors, but found they mostly
suck.

<p>

So, I've made my own.  To keep things simple, the editor assumes equally sized
small sprites arranged in a sprite sheet.  Editing is based on a single sprite
within the sprite sheet.

</ul>

Features:

<ul>

<li>Works on any modern browser, also works well on mobile (tablet). It stores
your image persistently so that it doesn't get lost when reloading the page.

<li>Sprite sheet based editing

<li>Data transfer via load/save PNG or data URLs

<li>Fixed palette, colour pick, colour hex code entry

<li>Various operations, like flip, rotate, shift, insert/delete row,
add outline, flood fill, merge

<li>Undo/Redo

<li>Realtime tiling preview

<li>Realtime animation preview with pingpong option

<li>Onion skinning

<li>Configurable interface colours, edit zoom, preview zoom, onion skin

</ul>

Known problems:

<ul>

<li>Persistent storage will not work in IE if you run the app from a file
rather than a website.

<li>Firefox sometimes fails to load a data URL or even restore state with a
security exception.  Generally this is resolved by reloading it.

</ul>
